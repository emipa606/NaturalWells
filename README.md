Add simple and hard ways to produce vanilla resources in late game.

# Natural Wells

Steam geysers now are Natural Wells. They don't spawn on map anymore;
They are created after build a Excavator, trigger him and wait for 3 days;
You can build awesome machines in natural wells, like:

# General Content

**Geothermal generator** (*For uninterrupted generation of eletricity*)
Now in two sizes: 5x5 and 3x3. The costs and production are proportional.

**Powered Drill** (*For infinite generation of resources*)
Require a huge amount of work and eletricity to produce this resources:
*(wood; chemfuel; steel; pasteel; silver; gold; jade; uranium)*;
Its done by miners and is faster if linked with a ground penetrating scanner;
Rare and precious resources are more difficult to extract.

**Steel Extractor** (*For automatic generation of steel*)
Require 1200w/h to produce 150 steel each two days. Deteriorate after 1 year.

**Uranium Power Cell** (*For generation of eletricty*)
Produce 3000w/h. Consumes 220 uranium per year;
Be careful, they are destroyed if stay empty;
*(don't must be placed on natural wells)*.

**Overpressure Bomb** (*For BIG explosions*)
This bomb don't trigger with damage (except EMP), only manually by colonists;
Causes a big explosion which destroys everything in a large area.
When you click on the bomb, you can see the range of the explosion.
Walls can protect colonists, but armours and clothes don't prevent the death.

**Matrix Chunks and Eletric Stonecutter**
The "Matrix Chunk" is added. It's very resistant and can be transformed in other blocks;
This chunk only can be founded in natural wells and extracted by powered drills;
You need eletric stonecutter workbench to transform him into blocks;
Also, this new workbench cuts other chunks 3 times faster than the vanilla stonecutter;
*(don't must be placed on natural wells)*.

# Compabilities

I don't recommend add this on existing saves (but maybe can works);
Works fine with other mods but needs patches to add new modded resources to powered drill.

# Balance

This mod is supposed be difficult, but not impossible to play;
*Why drills produce wood fro*--NO, DON'T DO THIS;
Feel free to suggest value changes on comments.
